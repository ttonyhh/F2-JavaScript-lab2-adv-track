### Lab 2, Advanced Track

1. Make sure you're logged in to your account on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right. This will create a new copy of the repo, one that's associated with your account. This will take you to your account on GitHub - notice that the name in the upper left has changed from "codefellows" to yours, and underneath it should say "forked from codefellows/lab2-adv-track".
3. Copy the link in the "HTTPS Clone URL" box on the right. Tip: that link should have your username in it, not codefellows.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to your projects directory.
5. Run this: `git clone paste-in-that-url-here`
6. `cd F2-JavaScript-lab2-adv-track`
7. Run `npm install`.
8. Your assignment is in lab2.js. There are detailed instructions in the
comments. Be sure to read everything. Run lab2.js with `node lab2.js`.
9. Before you turn in your assignment, run `grunt` to check for jshint and jscs errors/warnings. Fix all the errors.
10. List any resources you used (blogs, Stack Overflow questions, etc.) or collaborators below.
